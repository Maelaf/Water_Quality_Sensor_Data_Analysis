# Water_Quality_Sensor_Data_Analysis
# Data Analysis Project

## Business Overview

Data analysis involves examining, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to extract useful insights, draw conclusions, and support decision-making. It enables organizations to:

- **Make informed decisions** based on factual data rather than intuition.
- **Identify trends** in market behavior and operational performance.
- **Improve cost efficiency** by optimizing resources and reducing waste.
- **Gain customer insights** to personalize marketing and enhance satisfaction.
- **Manage risks** by identifying vulnerabilities and mitigating threats.
- **Achieve a competitive advantage** through responsive and innovative strategies.

## Project Aim

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing extensive water quality sensor data collected from various European countries over multiple periods using Power BI. The goal is to transform raw data into actionable insights by:

- Importing and cleaning data.
- Building relationships between datasets.
- Using DAX for calculated measures.
- Developing interactive dashboards with advanced visualizations.
- Uncovering trends, anomalies, and comparative insights.
- Supporting regulatory compliance and environmental sustainability.
- Leveraging Power BI features like drill-through, filters, and collaborative sharing.

## Data Description

The dataset comprises over **one million rows** with **32 columns** containing aggregated water sensor data across different European countries and time periods. It includes:

- **Country and water body categories**.
- **Determinands obtained**.
- **Concentration levels** (minimum, maximum, mean, median) at specific timestamps.
- **Quality samples conducted** vs. total samples per observation.
- **Ongoing data collection**, associating values with specific monitoring sites.

## Tech Stack

- **Tool:** Power BI  
- **Database:** Microsoft SQL Server  
- **Services:** Azure SQL Database
